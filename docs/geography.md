# Geography

Situated in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the Atlantic Ocean, the Azores extends along a west-northwest to east-southeast orientation. It lies between 36.5°–40° North latitudes and 24.5°–31.5° West longitudes, spanning an area approximately 600 km (373 mi) wide. The islands emerged from what is known as the **Azores Plateau**, a vast 5.8 million km² region that is morphologically accentuated by depths reaching 2,000 m (6,600 ft).

The archipelago comprises nine main islands and numerous smaller islets, covering a total surface area of 2,346 km² (906 sq mi). São Miguel is the largest island, while Corvo is the smallest.

## Surface Areas

The following table details the individual surface areas of the nine main Azorean islands:

| Island      | Area (km²) | Area (sq mi) |
| :---------- | :--------- | :----------- |
| São Miguel  | 759        | 293          |
| Pico        | 446        | 172          |
| Terceira    | 403        | 156          |
| São Jorge   | 246        | 95           |
| Faial       | 173        | 67           |
| Flores      | 143        | 55           |
| Santa Maria | 97         | 37           |
| Graciosa    | 62         | 24           |
| Corvo       | 17         | 7            |

## Distinct Geomorphological Characteristics of Each Island

Each of the Azorean islands possesses unique geomorphological characteristics:

* **Corvo:** As the smallest island, it features a prominent crater resulting from a major Plinian eruption;
* **Flores:** Located near the North American plate, Flores is a rugged island characterized by deeply carved valleys and steep escarpments;
* **Faial:** Known for its distinctive shield volcano and the impressive Caldeira Volcano;
* **Pico:** Home to the highest point in the Azores and continental Portugal, with an elevation of 2,351 m (7,713 ft);
* **Graciosa:** Notable for its active *Furnas do Enxofre* (sulfur caverns) and a diverse landscape of volcanic cones and plains;
* **São Jorge:** A long, slender island formed over thousands of years by successive fissural eruptions;
* **Terceira:** Almost circular in shape, it is distinguished by the location of one of the largest craters in the region;
* **São Miguel:** The largest island, marked by numerous large craters and extensive fields of spatter cones;
* **Santa Maria:** The oldest island in the archipelago, heavily eroded over time, and one of the few places in the Azores to feature brown sandy beaches.

## Island Groups

The Azorean islands are geographically organized into three recognizable groups, all situated on the Azores Plateau:

* **Eastern Group (Grupo Oriental):** São Miguel, Santa Maria, and the Formigas Islets;
* **Central Group (Grupo Central):** Terceira, Graciosa, São Jorge, Pico, and Faial;
* **Western Group (Grupo Ocidental):** Flores and Corvo.

Note: São Jorge, Pico, and Faial are collectively referred to as the *Ilhas do Triângulo* (Islands of the Triangle) due to their close proximity and triangular arrangement.

## Sub-surface Features

Beyond the visible islands, the Azores region also includes several significant sub-surface reefs and banks, such as the Dollabarat on the fringe of the Formigas Islets, the Princess Alice Bank, and the D. João de Castro Bank. These features, along with numerous hydrothermal vents and sea-mounts, are actively monitored due to their complex geotectonic and socioeconomic importance within the economic exclusion zone of the archipelago.
